# UX-UI-Figma
Hello friends :) 

I had been working with Figma for a year now when I was on the design team of the IEEE - IAS chapter. I started learning basic designing through Canvas, 
Later I worked my way up by learning the color theory, how to choose the right template, how to put the right elements, and position them. 
Here, I am attaching one of my UX/UI design projects that I did during my IEEE tenure. I have designed a music player web front end using Figma. My top inspirations were Spotify and Gaana.

I would like to thank IEEE for the amazing learning experience and exposure. I learned and upskilled myself a lot in designing. 
I was also a part of the initial process of the IEEE-IAS website design. Once again, I really enjoyed and learned in my tenure.
